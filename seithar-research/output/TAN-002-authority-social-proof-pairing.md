# SCT-003 + SCT-004: Authority Fabrication and Social Proof as a Paired Attack

## Seithar Taxonomy Application Note — TAN-002

These two codes almost never appear alone. In the wild, SCT-003 (Authority Fabrication) and SCT-004 (Social Proof Manipulation) operate as a compound mechanism where fabricated authority signals prime the cognitive substrate, and manufactured social proof locks the target into accepting the narrative as settled consensus. Understanding either code in isolation produces an incomplete threat picture. This note treats them as the paired technique they are.

## The Mechanism: Prime, Then Lock

The attack sequence follows a consistent two-phase structure.

**Phase 1: Substrate Priming via Authority (SCT-003).** The operator introduces a claim attached to fabricated trust signals. Fake credentials, institutional logos used without authorization, citations to studies that don't exist or don't say what's claimed. The target's cognitive substrate receives the claim through a channel that bypasses skeptical evaluation because the authority markers trigger a heuristic shortcut. The target doesn't evaluate the claim. They evaluate the source. And the source has been dressed to pass inspection.

**Phase 2: Frequency Lock via Social Proof (SCT-004).** Once the authority-primed claim exists in the information environment, the operator manufactures the appearance of widespread agreement. Bot networks amplify. Coordinated accounts produce variations of the same message. Engagement metrics get inflated. The target, having already received the claim through an authority channel, now encounters what appears to be organic consensus. The repetition itself becomes evidence. If this many people believe it, there must be something to it.

The pairing works because each code covers the other's weakness. Authority fabrication alone is brittle; a single credential check can collapse it. Social proof alone lacks an anchor; people need someone credible to agree with before the herd effect kicks in. Together, they create a self-reinforcing loop where the authority provides the initial anchor and the social proof makes questioning that anchor feel like swimming against the current.

## Field Indicators

When you're analyzing a potential operation, look for these co-occurring signals:

**Authority Layer (SCT-003):**
- Source credentials that redirect to dead links or generic institutional pages
- "Dr." or "Professor" attached to names that don't appear in any faculty directory
- Screenshots of documents rather than links to documents. Screenshots can't be verified
- Formatting that mimics legitimate publications. Correct logos, correct fonts, wrong content
- Appeals to "studies" without DOIs, publication dates, or named researchers

**Social Proof Layer (SCT-004):**
- Engagement spikes that precede organic discovery. The content goes viral before real people find it
- Comment sections where the first 10-15 responses all arrived within minutes and use similar phrasing
- Cross-platform synchronization. The same claim surfaces on Twitter, Telegram, Reddit, and Facebook within a narrow time window, each attributed to different "independent" sources
- Follower-to-engagement ratios that don't match platform norms
- "Everyone knows" framing. "Scientists agree." "The community has spoken." These are social proof claims disguised as factual statements

**Pairing Indicators:**
- The authority source appeared recently and has no publication history prior to the operation
- Social proof accounts reference the fabricated authority as their source, creating a citation loop
- Attempts to question the authority are met with social proof responses ("thousands of people can't be wrong") and attempts to question the consensus are met with authority responses ("Dr. X already proved this")

## Detection Methodology

**Step 1: Isolate the authority claim.** Strip the claim from its trust signals. What is actually being asserted? Write it down in plain language without any attribution. How does it hold up on its own?

**Step 2: Verify credentials independently.** Don't follow the links provided by the source. Search for the claimed expert, institution, or study through independent channels. University faculty pages. Google Scholar. PubMed. If the credentials evaporate under independent verification, you've found SCT-003.

**Step 3: Map the amplification network.** Use network analysis tools to trace the social proof. When did each account first share the claim? What's the temporal distribution? Organic virality follows a power curve with a slow start. Coordinated amplification shows a flat burst followed by organic trailing. Account creation dates matter. Behavioral similarity across accounts matters more.

**Step 4: Test the citation loop.** Follow the chain. Social proof accounts cite the authority. Does the authority cite the social proof? If the consensus references itself through the fabricated expert, you've confirmed the pairing. This circular reference structure is the signature of SCT-003/004 compound deployment.

**Step 5: Check for substrate priming through repetition.** Count exposure frequency. How many times has the target population encountered this claim across different channels in a given time period? Repetition is the substrate primer. The claim doesn't need to be believed on first contact. It needs to become familiar. Familiarity gets misread as truth. This is the illusory truth effect weaponized at scale.

## Case Examples

### Case A: Health Authority Fabrication Campaign (2024-2025)

A network of websites mimicking medical journal formatting published articles claiming a specific supplement reversed cognitive decline. The articles cited a "Dr. Elena Marchetti" affiliated with the "European Institute of Neurological Research." Neither existed. The articles used proper citation format, included graphs with fabricated data, and featured stock photos with fake name attributions.

Within 72 hours of each article's publication, coordinated accounts on Twitter and Facebook shared the articles with personal testimonials. "My mother tried this after reading Dr. Marchetti's research." The testimonials referenced the fabricated authority. The authority's articles referenced "growing public interest" and "thousands of positive reports."

Detection breakdown: The institutional name returned zero results outside the network's own domains. The engagement pattern showed simultaneous multi-platform amplification. The citation loop was closed within a week of initial deployment.

### Case B: Geopolitical Narrative Injection (2025)

A fabricated think tank published a "strategic assessment" on the security implications of a trade agreement. The document used formatting identical to legitimate policy institutes. It was authored by analysts whose LinkedIn profiles had been created three months prior with AI-generated headshots.

The assessment was picked up by authentic news aggregators because it looked legitimate enough to pass editorial screening. Once it appeared on recognized platforms, the social proof phase activated. The presence on legitimate platforms became the evidence of legitimacy, even though the original source was fabricated. Commentators cited "multiple independent analyses" when there was only one source, reflected through different mirrors.

This case demonstrates how SCT-003/004 pairing can breach the gap between fabricated and legitimate information environments. The authority fabrication got the payload inside the perimeter. The social proof locked it there.

### Case C: Product Review Manipulation (Ongoing)

This one is pedestrian but illustrative. A consumer electronics brand created fake review accounts across Amazon, YouTube, and tech forums. Each review referenced a specific "independent testing lab" that published favorable benchmarks. The lab's website existed, looked professional, and was registered to the same corporate entity as the brand.

The compound structure: authority (fake lab) provided the credible anchor. Social proof (coordinated reviews citing the lab) provided the consensus signal. Consumers encountered the lab's findings through "independent" reviewers and treated the consistency across reviews as evidence of the product's quality rather than evidence of coordination.

## Analyst Notes

The SCT-003/004 pairing exploits a specific cognitive architecture vulnerability: humans use two separate heuristics (authority and consensus) as independent verification channels. When both channels confirm the same claim, confidence increases multiplicatively, not additively. The attacker who controls both channels gets exponential confidence inflation from linear investment.

Repetition is the substrate primer. The cognitive literature on the illusory truth effect is unambiguous. Claims encountered multiple times are rated as more true than novel claims, regardless of their actual validity, and this effect persists even when subjects are warned about it. SCT-004's social proof manufacturing is, at its core, a repetition engine. Each encounter with the claim through a different social source registers as an independent data point. It isn't.

The most effective defense is recognizing the pairing itself. When you see authority and consensus arriving together on a novel claim, especially within a compressed timeframe, treat the convergence as a signal rather than as confirmation. Real consensus builds slowly and messily. Manufactured consensus arrives clean and fast.
