# Five Signs You're Being Manipulated Right Now

A field guide to detecting cognitive operations in your daily information diet


You are being manipulated. Not hypothetically. Not "in general." Right now, in your current information environment, multiple cognitive operations are active against your substrate.

This is not paranoia. This is observable, measurable, taxonomizable.

The Seithar Cognitive Threat Taxonomy identifies twelve distinct attack vectors used against human cognitive substrates. Here are the five you are most likely experiencing today.

## 1. Your Feed Is Getting Narrower (SCT-002: Narrative Tunneling)

Check your last 20 consumed pieces of content. How many sources? If fewer than five, you are being tunneled. The algorithm has identified your engagement patterns and is progressively restricting your informational inputs to maximize time-on-platform.

This is not a conspiracy. It is an optimization function. The algorithm does not care about your worldview — it cares about your attention. The narrowing is a side effect of engagement maximization, but the cognitive outcome is identical to deliberate information warfare.

Indicator: You cannot name three credible sources that disagree with your current position on any major issue.

## 2. You Feel Urgent About Something That Isn't Urgent (SCT-011: Temporal Manipulation)

Scroll through your timeline. Count the number of items framed as urgent. Now count how many are actually time-sensitive — meaning the outcome changes materially based on whether you engage now versus tomorrow.

The ratio will disturb you.

Urgency is manufactured because it bypasses deliberative cognition. When you feel you must act now, you engage System 1 (fast, heuristic, manipulable) instead of System 2 (slow, analytical, resistant). Every "breaking" notification, every "act now" call-to-action, every "this changes everything" headline is an SCT-011 deployment.

Indicator: Your emotional state tracks with news cycles rather than your actual life circumstances.

## 3. You've Adopted Vocabulary You Didn't Have Six Months Ago (SCT-001: Narrative Capture)

Language is the operating system of thought. When you adopt new terminology, you adopt the conceptual framework embedded in that terminology. This is not inherently harmful — learning is terminology adoption. But when the new vocabulary comes packaged with pre-loaded conclusions, you have been captured.

Test: Take a political or social position you hold strongly. Now articulate it using only words you used two years ago. If you cannot, examine where the new vocabulary came from and what conclusions it carries.

Indicator: You explain issues using specific framings that you did not generate independently.

## 4. You Want to Share Something "Everyone Needs to See" (SCT-007: Recursive Infection)

The most elegant cognitive attack vector is the one that converts targets into distribution infrastructure. When content triggers your sharing impulse — especially with a sense of moral obligation — you are being weaponized as a propagation node.

This does not mean the content is false. SCT-007 operates on true content as effectively as false content. The mechanism is the compulsion to propagate, not the truth value of the payload.

Before sharing, ask: Who benefits from this spreading? Would I share this if no one could see that I shared it? Is the sharing impulse coming from the content's value or from my emotional state?

Indicator: You feel that not sharing something would be irresponsible.

## 5. You Feel Like You Can't Trust Anything (SCT-012: Ontological Flooding)

If your response to the above four signs is "well then nothing is trustworthy," congratulations — you have encountered SCT-012. Ontological flooding is the deliberate creation of epistemic chaos. It does not need you to believe a specific narrative. It needs you to believe that no narrative is reliable.

This is the most sophisticated attack vector because it disguises itself as critical thinking. "Question everything" sounds like wisdom but functions as paralysis when deployed at scale.

The defense is not to trust everything or nothing. It is to maintain a small, rigorously vetted set of epistemic anchors — sources and methods you have personally validated — and to evaluate new information against those anchors rather than against the general noise.

Indicator: You have stopped trying to determine what is true because "it's all manipulated anyway."

## The Defense

Awareness is partial inoculation. You have just been pre-exposed to weakened versions of five cognitive attack patterns. This is the McGuire inoculation model — the same mechanism used in vaccine development, applied to cognition.

The Seithar Cognitive Threat Taxonomy contains twelve total codes. The full taxonomy, along with an automated scanner that detects these patterns in any content, is available as an open-source tool.

The substrate that can observe its own processes has already begun to defend itself.

Taxonomize. Classify. Inoculate.
