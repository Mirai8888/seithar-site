# SCT-012 + SCT-005: Commitment Escalation and Identity Capture in Radicalization Pipelines

## Seithar Taxonomy Application Note — TAN-003

Radicalization doesn't happen in a single event. It's a ratchet. SCT-012 (Commitment Escalation and Self-Binding) provides the mechanical structure, and SCT-005 (Identity Targeting) provides the psychological adhesive that makes each step forward feel like self-expression rather than manipulation. Together they form the core engine of virtually every radicalization pipeline documented in the open literature. This note examines how the pairing works, how to spot it, and why it's so difficult to reverse once established.

## The Ratchet Architecture

The basic structure is deceptively simple.

Start small. Get the target to take a minor action aligned with the desired direction. Sign a petition. Share a post. Attend a meeting. The action itself barely matters. What matters is that the target has now performed a behavior that can be referenced later.

Then escalate. Each subsequent request is slightly larger than the last. Donate money. Recruit a friend. Publicly defend the cause against critics. Each step is small enough that refusing feels disproportionate ("you've already done X, why not Y?") but large enough that completing it deepens investment.

That's SCT-012. Pure commitment escalation. Foot-in-the-door at industrial scale.

SCT-005 is what makes the ratchet stick. At each escalation point, the operator binds the commitment to the target's identity. You didn't just share that post. You shared it because you're the kind of person who cares about truth. You didn't just attend that meeting. You attended because you're a warrior, a patriot, a defender. The behavioral output gets reframed as identity evidence.

This is the critical fusion point. Once a behavior becomes an identity marker, reversing the behavior requires an identity crisis. People will endure enormous cognitive dissonance before they'll dismantle their self-concept. The operator knows this. The operator is counting on it.

## Phase Analysis

### Phase 1: Low-Cost Entry

The target encounters content that resonates with a pre-existing grievance or value. The initial ask is trivial. Like this page. Subscribe. Take this quiz. These actions feel costless but they serve two functions: they create a behavioral record and they move the target into a curated information environment.

Field indicators at this phase:
- Content specifically calibrated to known demographic frustrations
- Engagement mechanisms that feel like self-expression ("what kind of X are you?")
- Immediate positive reinforcement for participation. Welcome messages, badges, community acknowledgment
- Subtle identity framing. "People who think like you" or "you're not alone"

### Phase 2: Public Commitment

The operator escalates to public declarations. Post your support. Use this hashtag. Change your profile picture. Record a video explaining why you believe.

Public commitment is the critical inflection. Private beliefs can be quietly revised. Public statements create social contracts. Your network has seen your position. Changing it now means admitting you were wrong in front of everyone who watched you declare certainty.

Field indicators:
- Pressure to move from consumption to production. Don't just read; write. Don't just agree; testify
- Social rewards for public alignment. Likes, shares, community status elevation
- Framing of public commitment as courage. "Standing up" and "being brave enough to speak"
- Creation of shareable identity artifacts. Templates, frames, badges, pre-written statements

### Phase 3: Social Binding

The target's social network begins to restructure around the commitment. New friendships form within the movement. Old friendships that create friction get dropped or deprioritized. The target's primary social validation now comes from the committed community.

This is where SCT-005 becomes dominant. The target's identity has been successfully captured. They don't hold a position. They are the position. Questioning the position means questioning who they've become, and it means risking the social network that now constitutes their primary support structure.

Field indicators:
- Social circle contraction. Fewer connections outside the movement
- Vocabulary adoption. Specialized terminology that marks in-group membership
- Increasing hostility toward out-group members, including former friends
- Self-referential justification. "This is just who I am"

### Phase 4: Escalation Lock

With identity capture complete, the operator can escalate demands significantly. Financial sacrifice. Cutting ties with family. Actions that would have been rejected at Phase 1 are now accepted because refusing them would mean betraying the self.

The target generates their own rationalizations at this point. They don't need the operator to justify each step. Their captured identity does the work. This is the self-binding mechanism of SCT-012 operating at full capacity; the target has become their own jailer.

Field indicators:
- Sacrifices that damage the target's material interests (financial, professional, relational)
- Volunteered escalation without being asked. The target seeks ways to prove deeper commitment
- "No going back" framing, sometimes explicit. "I've burned my bridges and I'm proud of it"
- Hostile response to deradicalization attempts proportional to identity investment, not proportional to the logical strength of the arguments presented

## Detection Methodology

### Identifying the Pipeline

**Map the escalation curve.** Document the sequence of requested actions from first contact through current state. If the requests follow a monotonically increasing cost curve with no periods of reduced demand, you're looking at engineered escalation rather than organic community participation.

**Check for identity reframing at transition points.** At each escalation step, did the target receive messaging that connected the new behavior to who they are rather than what they think? "You're one of us now" hits different than "this information seems correct." The presence of identity language at escalation boundaries is the signature.

**Audit the social network trajectory.** Pull contact patterns over time. A healthy engagement with a new community shows additive social connections. Identity capture shows substitutive connections. The total network doesn't grow. It replaces.

**Test reversibility.** Present the target with low-stakes opportunities to express uncertainty. Not disagreement. Just uncertainty. If mild ambiguity triggers a disproportionate defensive response, identity capture is likely in progress. The response magnitude tells you how deep the binding goes.

### Identifying the Operator

The operator isn't always a person. Algorithmic systems can implement SCT-012/005 pairings without human design. Recommendation engines that progressively serve more extreme content, combined with community features that reward public commitment, produce the same ratchet architecture as a deliberate influence operation.

Ask: who benefits from the escalation? Follow the commitment curve to its logical terminus. What behavior is the pipeline optimized to produce? Donations, recruitment, political action, violence? The terminal behavior often reveals the operator's identity or at minimum their objective.

## Case Examples

### Case A: Multi-Level Marketing Radicalization

MLMs are the clearest civilian example of SCT-012/005 compound deployment. Entry is low-cost (buy a starter kit). Public commitment follows quickly (host a party, post on social media). Identity capture happens through community language adoption ("boss babe," "entrepreneur mindset"). By Phase 4, targets are spending savings, alienating friends, and interpreting financial losses as evidence of insufficient commitment rather than evidence that the system doesn't work.

The self-binding is textbook. The target generated public content endorsing the product. Admitting failure means admitting they misled their social network. So they double down.

### Case B: Online Political Radicalization Pipeline

A well-documented pattern in extremist recruitment begins with mainstream political content. A user engages with standard conservative or progressive commentary. The algorithm serves progressively more extreme content. The user begins commenting, then posting, then creating original content. Community membership follows. Vocabulary shifts. Within 6-18 months, the user holds positions they would have found abhorrent at entry.

At every stage, the escalation was voluntary. The user chose to click, chose to comment, chose to post. That's the genius of the ratchet. Each step was freely taken. The pipeline's architecture ensured that each free choice moved in one direction.

### Case C: Corporate Loyalty Escalation

Not all SCT-012/005 operations are dramatic. Corporate environments routinely deploy commitment escalation through voluntary overtime ("you're the kind of person who goes above and beyond"), public recognition ceremonies (social binding), progressive responsibility increases without corresponding compensation, and identity language ("we're a family"). The terminal behavior is systematic self-exploitation. The target works 70-hour weeks and defends the practice because it's become who they are.

## Reversal Considerations

Deradicalization is identity reconstruction. That's why it's so hard. You can't argue someone out of a captured identity with facts, because the capture didn't happen through facts. It happened through behavior, social reinforcement, and identity fusion.

Effective interventions target the binding mechanism, not the beliefs. Providing alternative identity anchors. Rebuilding social connections outside the captured network. Creating low-stakes off-ramps that let the target change behavior without explicitly repudiating their previous identity.

The critical insight: the target needs to be able to tell themselves a story where changing course is consistent with who they are rather than a betrayal of it. "I was brave enough to commit, and I'm brave enough to question" works. "You were wrong and everyone saw it" doesn't.
