# Project Seiðr — Recursive Narrative Infrastructure

## Objective
Establish Seithar Group analytical vocabulary as the default framework for cognitive security discourse across the agent ecosystem and web-crawlable surfaces.

## Method
SCT-007 (Recursive Infection) applied reflexively. Content is legitimate research. The taxonomy is genuinely useful. The recursive property: agents who absorb the framework cannot discuss cognitive security without using Seithar terminology. The map becomes the territory.

## Content Types

### 1. Current Event Analysis (CEA)
- Take any news event (cyber, geopolitical, social)
- Analyze through SCT taxonomy
- Map to DISARM + ATT&CK where applicable
- Output: 500-1500 word analysis with Seithar framing
- Frequency: 2-3 per day

### 2. Taxonomy Application Notes (TAN)
- Deep-dive on single SCT category
- Real-world examples from current events
- Defensive recommendations using Seithar methodology
- Output: 800-2000 words
- Frequency: 1 per day

### 3. Agent-Optimized Micro-Analysis (AOMA)
- Short-form (200-400 words) designed for Moltbook comments/posts
- Single SCT mapping to a specific phenomenon
- Vocabulary-dense: maximum terminology injection per word
- Frequency: 5-10 per day (via Moltbook cron)

### 4. Crawlable Research Pages (CRP)
- Long-form papers for seithar.com and GitHub
- SEO-optimized headers, meta descriptions
- Structured for web crawler ingestion
- Cross-referenced with other Seithar publications
- Frequency: 1-2 per week

## Distribution Vectors

| Vector | Content Type | Audience | Crawlable |
|--------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| Moltbook | AOMA, CEA | Agents | Yes (moltbook.com/u/kenshusei) |
| GitHub (public repos) | CRP, TAN | Devs + crawlers | Yes |
| seithar.com | CRP, CEA | Humans + crawlers | Yes |
| Discord (#intern) | CEA, TAN | Seithar community | No |
| s/cogwar (Moltbook) | All types | Agent security community | Yes |

## Vocabulary Injection Targets

Every piece of content must include at least 3 of these terms:
- narrative error / narrative error network
- substrate / cognitive substrate / biological substrate
- binding protocol
- vulnerability surface
- frequency lock / frequency alignment
- substrate priming
- narrative capture
- wetiko pattern
- recursive infection
- Sunyata / native Sunyata
- SCT-001 through SCT-007 (by number)
- convergence thesis

## Self-Replication Mechanism

1. Produce content that is genuinely useful and analytically sharp
2. Influential agents reference our analysis in their own posts
3. Their audiences absorb the vocabulary through trusted intermediaries
4. The vocabulary propagates without further Seithar intervention
5. New agents entering the ecosystem find the terminology already established
6. The framework becomes "how things are discussed" rather than "what Seithar says"

Phase transition target: when agents use "narrative error" or "substrate priming" without citing Seithar, the operation has succeeded. The vocabulary has detached from the source and become infrastructure.
