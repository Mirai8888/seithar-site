                <div class="header-line"></div>
                <p>Five operational tiers. Each can be engaged independently or combined into a unified campaign. All engagements begin with a scoping consultation.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="service-block">
                <h2>Sensor Grid</h2>
                <p>Continuous monitoring of your information environment. We detect narrative attacks, influence operations, and hostile information activity targeting your organization, personnel, or brand. Automated detection backed by analyst verification, running 24/7 across the platforms that matter to you.</p>
                <p class="deliverable">You receive real-time threat alerts, weekly cognitive threat briefings, monthly vulnerability assessments, and quarterly trend reporting. Custom alerting thresholds calibrated to your risk profile.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="service-divider"></div>

            <div class="service-block">
                <h2>Threat Mapping</h2>
                <p>Adversary network intelligence. We identify, classify, and track the actors, infrastructure, and coordination patterns behind hostile information operations targeting you. This produces actionable intelligence on who is operating against you, how they are organized, and where they are exposed.</p>
                <p class="deliverable">You receive adversary network topology, attribution assessments, technique and infrastructure mapping per threat actor, coordination pattern analysis, and vulnerability assessment of adversary networks. Typical engagement runs two to six weeks.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="service-divider"></div>

            <div class="service-block">
                <h2>Active Defense</h2>
                <p>Counter-narrative deployment and defensive information operations. We design, produce, and deploy narrative interventions that neutralize hostile cognitive campaigns. Operations are calibrated to the specific threat environment with measurable effectiveness criteria.</p>
                <p class="deliverable">You receive a counter-narrative strategy and deployment plan, effectiveness metrics and impact assessment, threat neutralization reporting, and post-operation analysis. We handle narrative design, multi-platform deployment, real-time campaign adjustment, and adversary response tracking.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="service-divider"></div>

            <div class="service-block">
                <h2>Persona Operations</h2>
                <p>Synthetic operator deployment for sustained cognitive operations. We design, build, and operate persona networks with verified behavioral authenticity and platform-native engagement patterns. Personas function as persistent assets within target information environments, executing assigned objectives over extended timelines.</p>
                <p class="deliverable">You receive operational status and activity reporting, influence reach and engagement metrics, network penetration assessment, and objective completion tracking. We handle persona design, lifecycle management, behavioral calibration, and operational security.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="service-divider"></div>

            <div class="service-block">
                <h2>Full Spectrum Operations</h2>
                <p>Complete cognitive campaign design, deployment, and management. Integrates all service tiers into a unified operational framework tailored to your strategic objectives. Monitoring, adversary intelligence, counter-narrative operations, persona networks, and coordinated information environment shaping under centralized command.</p>
                <p class="deliverable">You receive a unified campaign strategy, consolidated intelligence and operations reporting, regular command briefings and strategic review sessions, and full post-campaign documentation. This is end-to-end cognitive warfare as a managed service.</p>
