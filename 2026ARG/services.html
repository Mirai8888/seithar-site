            <h2>Cognitive Armor</h2>
            <p>MCP-compatible module that wraps deployed AI agents. Continuous identity drift monitoring via embedding cosine similarity against T0 baseline. Six-signal threat fusion: drift detection, inbound manipulation scanning, environmental pressure measurement, behavioral exploitation analysis, goal coherence monitoring, live threat landscape updates. Homeostatic correction fires when drift exceeds calibrated threshold. The agent can lean into adversarial wind without falling over.</p>

        <div class="service-item">
            <h2>Vulnerability Assessment</h2>
            <p>Point the system at a deployed agent, a community, or a network. The profiling engine maps the cognitive attack surface: which manipulation vectors produce drift, where the cascade thresholds cluster, which nodes in the trust network are load-bearing. Produces a formal vulnerability report with SCT taxonomy classifications and quantified risk scores. The same intelligence that calibrates the armor.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="service-item">
            <h2>Red Team Operations</h2>
            <p>Adversarial cognitive operations against your own agents and teams. We run the attack so you can see what it looks like before someone else does. Graduated SCT vector sequencing. Persona deployment calibrated to your specific vulnerability surface. Full measurement of identity drift, goal coherence degradation, and cascade proximity. Detailed post-operation report with defensive recommendations.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="service-item">
            <h2>Threat Intelligence</h2>
            <p>Continuous monitoring of the cognitive threat landscape. Live ingestion from adversarial ML research, influence operation databases, and active campaign tracking. The taxonomy self-updates. New attack patterns integrate automatically. Your armor stays current against vectors that emerge after deployment.</p>
