I was reading Hofstadter's Gödel, Escher, Bach the week prior, which explicitly programs you to \"hear\" fugue as metaphor for consciousness and self-reference. the recording I heard was Nikolayeva's because the recommendation engine knows people who listen to Bach and click on philosophy podcasts will engage with that particular interpretation. even the fact that it's unfinished only matters because I'd absorbed romantic mythology about the fragmentary-sublime, about ruins and incompletion as more authentic than finished works" },

I couldn't hide behind the \"societal busyness\" anymore, because that didn't exist there. I tried to look away from the paintings, just to witness other attendees, who would look at me, because of my nervousness. I would try not to look at either the attendees or the paintings, but I felt their looks. I cant just hide from people, there are painting on the ceilings. I cant hide form paintings, there are people everywhere. If I tried to close my eyes, my nose would be bombarded with the burning wicks of candles. if I tried to ignore my olfactory senses, The heat of those candles would envelop and pierce me through all of my winter layers.

I liked the song, so I added it. After that, Spotify's algorithms began aggressively recommending entire genres of crushcore, hyperpop, and so on. I gradually got hooked, and my main playlist began to fill up with it. But the moment of truth came later. I turned on shuffle and heard a song that had been my absolute favorite just a year ago. And instead of joy, I felt sadness and a desire to quickly switch to something more edgy and energetic, to the very music the algorithms persistently fed me. That's when I realized that my current \"want\" wasn't my sincere desire. I wanted to escape this longing for a personal connection with old songs, even though I wanted to listen to old songs until they wore out over and over again. But I felt like I needed some rhythm, something louder, something more cheerful, something to escape and not think about. I feel like I'm degrading because of this kind of music. I feel sad and ashamed." },

Many years later I had returned to my childhood home which would be sold shortly thereafter. There was a box of CDs. Gorillaz - Self Titled. License to Ill. Poodle Hat. Poodle hat...\"man...I would love to listen to this right now, I remember loving this one song...what was it? French? Genius in France!\" That pop sound of the plastic cover coming loose. The feeling of the tight ring around my pinky as I scooted towards the equally old boombox.   The entire song, the one I used to run and jump around my room to, was a direct homage to Frank Zappa. The feeling I felt from that moment, realizing that I had been primed well beyond the scope of my attention to love Frank's signature sounds... it was a transformation.

I liked the song, so I added it. After that, Spotify's algorithms began aggressively recommending entire genres of crushcore, hyperpop, and so on. I gradually got hooked, and my main playlist began to fill up with it. But the moment of truth came later. I turned on shuffle and heard a song that had been my absolute favorite just a year ago. And instead of joy, I felt sadness and a desire to quickly switch to something more edgy and energetic, to the very music the algorithms persistently fed me. That's when I realized that my current \"want\" wasn't my sincere desire. I wanted to escape this longing for a personal connection with old songs, even though I wanted to listen to old songs until they wore out over and over again. But I felt like I needed some rhythm, something louder, something more cheerful, something to escape and not think about. I feel like I'm degrading because of this kind of music. I feel sad and ashamed." },

Many years later I had returned to my childhood home which would be sold shortly thereafter. There was a box of CDs. Gorillaz - Self Titled. License to Ill. Poodle Hat. Poodle hat...\"man...I would love to listen to this right now, I remember loving this one song...what was it? French? Genius in France!\" That pop sound of the plastic cover coming loose. The feeling of the tight ring around my pinky as I scooted towards the equally old boombox.   The entire song, the one I used to run and jump around my room to, was a direct homage to Frank Zappa. The feeling I felt from that moment, realizing that I had been primed well beyond the scope of my attention to love Frank's signature sounds... it was a transformation.
