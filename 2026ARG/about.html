            <h1>Seithar Group</h1>
            <p>Cognitive warfare operations for private sector clients. Defense and offense.</p>
            <p>The name derives from the Old Norse practice of Seithr: the binding and shaping of informational threads. The methodology is modern. The problem is ancient. Someone is always trying to control what you believe, and most organizations have no capacity to detect it, let alone respond.</p>
            <p>Seithar Group operates as a private military contractor for the information environment. We provide the same caliber of cognitive operations capability that nation-states maintain internally, available to private sector clients who need it. Monitoring, intelligence, counter-operations, and offensive campaign design, executed by practitioners with direct operational experience.</p>
            <p>Our tooling is built in-house. HoleSpawn handles cognitive vulnerability profiling and autonomous threat surface mapping. ThreatMouth maintains adversarial awareness through continuous intelligence calibration. ThreadMap unifies technical exploitation infrastructure with cognitive operation chain modeling into a single analytical surface. These are not products for sale. They are the operational backbone of every engagement we run.</p>
            <p>We work on consultation. If you have a problem in the information environment, we will tell you whether we can solve it.</p>
