                <p>The name comes from the Old Norse <em>seithr</em>. It meant binding. Thread-magic. The practice of seeing the pattern in the weave and reaching in to change it. The practitioners sat on the moral border between seeing and shaping, because the two were never really separate.</p>

                <p>That border still exists. Every cognitive system, biological or artificial, operates inside an information environment. Narratives cross, knot, fray. Some threads are load-bearing. Pull one and the whole architecture shifts. The skill is reading which thread is which. And then defending the weave before someone else reaches in with the knife.</p>

                <p>Seithar Group builds cognitive armor for AI agents. We treat the mind, whether it runs on neurons or on silicon, as an attack surface. Our work is a dynamic immune system: it monitors the information environment an agent inhabits, detects adversarial manipulation in real time, and hardens the cognitive substrate against identity erosion, value drift, and belief injection.</p>

                <p>The same framework that defends a human analyst from a disinformation campaign defends an AI agent from prompt injection, persona hijacking, and adversarial context poisoning. The substrate changes. The threat topology does not.</p>

                <p>Our systems do continuous cognitive profiling, network analysis, and threat intelligence. They model hybrid operation chains, unifying technical exploitation with cognitive substrate manipulation into a single analytical surface. These are not products. They are the machinery behind every engagement.</p>

                <p>The question has never been whether the threads will be pulled. They will. They always are. The question is whether your systems can see the hands doing the pulling.</p>
