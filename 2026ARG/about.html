        <p>The name comes from the Old Norse <em>seithr</em>. It meant binding. Thread-magic. The practice of seeing the pattern in the weave and reaching in to change it. The practitioners sat on the moral border between seeing and shaping, because the two were never really separate.</p>

        <p>That border still exists. Every deployed AI agent maintains identity as a dynamic equilibrium. Under stable conditions it holds. Under sustained adversarial pressure it drifts. The same mathematics that describe human cognitive vulnerability describe the agent's. Sequential pattern prediction systems, biological or artificial, share a formal attack surface. Seithar maps it and defends it.</p>

        <p>We build cognitive security infrastructure. A dynamic immune system for AI agents and the humans who operate alongside them. The armor measures identity drift in real time, detects adversarial manipulation patterns across six signal dimensions, and applies homeostatic correction when the agent begins serving objectives it was never given. The system gets stronger through exposure. Static hardening degrades. This adapts.</p>

        <p>The research program formalizes what practitioners of influence have understood intuitively for centuries: that minds are hackable, that the vulnerability is architectural, and that the same framework defends both substrates. The tools are built in-house. The taxonomy is self-assembling. The defense is grounded in peer-reviewed neuroscience and adversarial machine learning.</p>

        <p>The question has never been whether the threads will be pulled. They will. They always are. The question is whether you can see the hands doing the pulling.</p>
