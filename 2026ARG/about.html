            <p>The name comes from the Old Norse <em>seithr</em>. It meant binding. Thread-magic. The practice of seeing the pattern in the weave and reaching in to change it. The practitioners sat on the moral border between seeing and shaping, because the two were never really separate.</p>

            <p>That border still exists. Every information environment is a weave. Narratives cross, knot, fray. Some threads are load-bearing. Pull one and the whole pattern shifts. The skill is reading which is which. And then, depending on the mandate, defending the weave or reaching in with the knife.</p>

            <p>Seithar Group is a private military contractor for cognitive warfare. We provide the same class of information operations capability that nation-states run internally, made available to private sector clients who need it. Someone is running an influence campaign against your organization. We can tell you who, show you how, and give you the instruments to respond. Or we respond for you.</p>

            <p>Our tools are built in-house. HoleSpawn does cognitive profiling and network analysis. ThreatMouth runs continuous threat intelligence. ThreadMap models hybrid operation chains. The scanner reads information environments for active manipulation in real time. None of these are products. They are the machinery behind every engagement.</p>

            <p>The question has never been whether the threads will be pulled. They will. They always are. The question is whether you can see the hands doing the pulling.</p>
